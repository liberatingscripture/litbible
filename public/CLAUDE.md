# Static files and headers (`public/`)

- **Security headers / CSP** live in `public/_headers` (deploy-only — `dev`
  and `astro preview` don't apply them). The CSP is deliberately split (owner
  decision 2026-07-10): an ENFORCED header carries only structural directives
  that can never break an integration (`frame-ancestors`, `object-src`,
  `base-uri`, `form-action`), while the full resource allowlist
  (script/connect/frame/img/etc.) is `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` —
  documentation + telemetry, blocks nothing. Two maintenance rules:
  (1) if a form's backend changes (as when the self-hosted contact Worker
  replaced Formspree), update the enforced `form-action` list in the same
  change;
  (2) when adding any new third-party integration, add its origins to the
  report-only allowlist so it stays an accurate inventory. **Revisit enforcing
  the full policy if the site ever gains logins/accounts/sessions** (e.g. a
  members area) — the "static site with no secrets" premise behind the
  report-only decision stops holding at that point.
- **Agent/AI discovery surface** lives in static files, all served as-is from
  `public/`. They only take effect on a deployed Cloudflare Pages site — `dev`
  and `astro preview` do **not** apply `_headers`:
  - `public/.well-known/api-catalog` — RFC 9727/9264 `linkset+json` pointing at
    the public API (`/api/content.json`, `/api/manifest.json`) with `service-doc`
    (→ `llms-full.txt`) and `status` (→ `/api/version.json`) relations. It's
    extensionless, so `_headers` sets its `Content-Type: application/linkset+json`.
  - `public/_headers` adds `Link:` headers (RFC 8288) on `/*` advertising the
    catalog (`rel="api-catalog"`) and docs (`rel="service-doc"`).
  - `public/robots.txt` carries a `Content-Signal` line. Keep it consistent with
    the CC BY-NC-ND license and `llms.txt`: `ai-train=no` (no broad LLM training),
    `search=yes`, `ai-input=yes` (RAG/inference welcome). The site has no auth,
    MCP server, or write API, so OAuth/MCP/WebMCP discovery files are intentionally
    absent — don't add them without a real backing service.
