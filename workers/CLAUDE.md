# Cloudflare Workers

- **The contact + app-support forms are self-hosted**: `/contact` posts to
  `/contact/submit` and `/app-support` posts to `/app-support/submit`, both
  served by a single standalone Cloudflare Worker in `workers/contact-form/`
  (deliberately outside `/api/*`, the app-sync namespace) that verifies the
  Turnstile token server-side and delivers mail via Email Routing's
  `send_email` binding. The Worker keys off the request pathname to pick a
  per-form config: each form has its own Turnstile widget (own secret) and its
  own destination inbox, so app-support mail lands in a different inbox than
  contact mail. Each route also takes an optional `*_DISPLAY_TO` secret — a
  branded alias shown in the `To:` header while delivery still targets the real
  (verified) inbox, with a one-time retry if Cloudflare rejects the mismatch
  (mirrors the liberatingscripture.org contact Worker). It deploys separately
  from the site (owner-run `wrangler
  deploy` — see its README, which also carries the one-time dashboard/secret
  setup for the app-support route); native POSTs (the fallback when fetch is
  blocked; Turnstile still needs JS to render, so a genuinely JS-less visitor
  can't pass the check) 303-redirect to the matching `…/thanks/` page.
  **Adding a route means redeploying the Worker before the site deploy that
  publishes the new form**, or the POST hits the Pages 404.
