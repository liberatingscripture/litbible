# LIT Bible — Claude Project Instructions

> **Maintain this file.** It is the orientation doc for every future Claude Code
> session, so keep it accurate to how the repo *actually* works — not a changelog.
> When you change build steps, directory layout, data formats, conventions, or
> add/remove a major feature, update the relevant section here in the same change.
> Describe organizing principles and the "why," not one-off edits. If a section
> here contradicts the code, the code wins — fix the doc. Prune anything stale.
>
> **Update `README.md` too when appropriate.** It's the human-facing front door
> (lighter and friendlier; CLAUDE.md is the deep reference). When a change affects
> what it documents — the overview, getting-started/setup steps, common commands,
> or the high-level project layout — update `README.md` in the same change.
> Keep it lighter than this file and avoid hardcoded specifics that drift (exact
> version numbers, file counts); prefer "run this command to check."

## Project Overview

**LIT Bible** ([litbible.net](https://litbible.net)) is a static website for the
*Liberation and Inclusion Translation* (LIT) of the New Testament — a
trauma-informed, justice-oriented translation from the original languages,
produced by the Liberating Scripture Collective. The site is built with Astro
and uses a **content-as-data architecture**: scripture lives in 260 JSON chapter
files (one per NT chapter), and supporting content (book intros, glossary,
articles) lives in Markdown. There is no database and no CMS — the repo *is* the
content store, and the build compiles it into a static site plus JSON APIs that
companion iOS/Android apps consume.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro 6 (static site generator; `output` is static)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode, `astro/tsconfigs/strict`)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (no utility framework). Global stylesheet + a
  per-page stylesheet under `src/styles/pages/`
- **Search**: Pagefind (static, build-time index over `dist/`)
- **Fonts**: `@fontsource` (Crimson Text, Fraunces, Inter, OpenDyslexic)
- **Icons**: simple-icons
- **Client JS**: Hand-written vanilla JS in `src/scripts/` (progressive
  enhancement only — no client framework, no hydration). The site is fully
  functional with JS disabled.

## Common Commands

```bash
npm run dev               # Dev server at localhost:4321
npm run build             # Full production build (see pipeline below)
npm run preview           # Build + astro preview locally
npm run validate:chapters # Validate all chapter JSON (structure + references)
npm run fix:chapters      # Re-serialize chapter JSON to normalize formatting
npm run build:topics      # Regenerate topics indexes only
npm run build:api         # Regenerate public/api/content.json only
npm run build:manifest    # Regenerate API manifest + /api/data for the mobile apps
npm run draft:release-notes -- --since <ref>  # Draft a release-notes entry from git diff
```

### Build Pipeline (`npm run build`, in order)

1. `fetch:podcast` — refreshes `src/data/podcast-feed.xml` from RedCircle. The
   committed XML is a snapshot; a fetch failure reuses it and **never fails the
   build**.
2. `build:topics` — generates `public/topics-index.json` (topic → chapters) and
   `public/search/topics.json` (autocomplete) from chapter `topics` arrays.
3. `build:api` — generates `public/api/content.json` (full NT in canonical order).
4. `build:manifest` — generates `public/api/manifest.json` and copies content
   files into `public/api/data/` so the native apps can diff hashes and download
   only changed files. Also exposes intro images under `images/`.
5. `astro build` — compiles the site to `dist/`.
6. `pagefind --site dist` — builds the search index into `dist/pagefind/`.

> Note: client-side code lives in `src/scripts/` while build-time Node scripts
> live in the top-level `scripts/`. Don't confuse the two.

### Routing (`src/pages/`)

| Route | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `/<book>-<chapter>` | `[slug].astro` | Scripture chapter ("Study View") |
| `/<book>-intro` | `[book]-intro.astro` | Book introduction |
| `/read` | `read.astro` | Reading-mode landing |
| `/read/<book>` | `read/[book].astro` | Continuous reading view of a book |
| `/articles`, `/articles/<slug>` | `articles.astro`, `articles/[...slug].astro` | Articles |
| `/glossary` | `glossary.astro` | Glossary |
| `/search` | `search.astro` | Pagefind search UI |
| `/release-notes` | `release-notes.astro` | "What's new" |
| others | `about`, `contact`, `courses`, `support`, `privacy`, `unsubscribe`, `found-in-translation-podcast`, `liberating-scripture-collective`, `translation-commitments`, `404` |

Redirects (`/read-now`→`/read`, `/podcast`→`/found-in-translation-podcast`) and
the sitemap filter live in `astro.config.mjs`.

## Build / Validation Scripts (`scripts/`)

| Script | Role |
|--------|------|
| `validate-chapters.mjs` | Validates chapter JSON (with `--fix` to re-serialize). Driven by `chapter_json_invariants.json`. |
| `chapter_json_invariants.json` | Documents validation rules (e.g. the `indexed` flag). |
| `build-topics-index.mjs` | Topic indexes (`normalizeTopic` slugifies labels). |
| `build-api-json.mjs` | `public/api/content.json`. |
| `build-api-manifest.mjs` | `public/api/manifest.json` + `public/api/data/` for the native apps. |
| `fetch-podcast-feed.mjs` | Refresh podcast XML snapshot (non-fatal on failure). |
| `draft-release-notes.mjs` | Drafts release-notes entries from git diffs (used by CI). |

## Chapter JSON Format

Each file in `src/data/chapters/` follows this structure:

```json
{
  "bookKey": "john",
  "chapter": 3,
  "type": "scripture",
  "title": "John 3",
  "description": "John 3 in the Liberation and Inclusion Translation (LIT).",
  "topics": ["Nicodemus", "born again", "God so loved the world"],
  "paragraphs": [
    "<p id=\"john-3-p1\"><span class=\"vglue\"><sup id=\"v1\" class=\"vn\">1</sup>&nbsp;There was a Pharisee...</span>..."
  ],
  "footnotes": [
    { "id": "fn-a", "refId": "fnref-a", "label": "a", "html": "Footnote content as HTML..." }
  ]
}
```

- **`type`** is `"scripture"` on every chapter (not a genre label).
- **Verse numbers** are `<sup id="vN" class="vn">N</sup>`, always wrapped as
  `<span class="vglue"><sup…></sup>&nbsp;<first word>…</span>` so the number
  stays glued to the verse's first word.
- **`topics`** are free-text labels (e.g. `"Nicodemus"`), not pre-slugged.
  `build-topics-index.mjs` normalizes them into slugs and groups chapters that
  share a topic.
- **`footnotes`** are HTML strings; the verse text references them via
  `<sup class="fn-ref">` anchors (Pagefind excludes these — see `pagefind.yml`).
- **`indexed: false`** (optional) marks an in-progress **draft/stub chapter**.
  56 of 260 chapters are currently drafts. This flag has three downstream
  effects, so handle it carefully:
  1. Pagefind skips the page (kept out of search).
  2. `astro.config.mjs` excludes the slug from the sitemap, and a `/read/<book>`
     page is excluded only when *every* chapter of that book is a draft.
  3. The page is `noindex`'d.
  **Remove the field** (do not set it to `true`) when real content lands. The
  validator warns if `indexed:false` remains on a chapter that has real content.
- Always run `npm run validate:chapters` after editing chapter JSON. The
  pre-commit hook validates staged chapter files automatically.

## Content Collections (`src/content.config.ts`)

Two collections, both loaded via Astro's `glob` loader:

- **`articles`** — `src/content/articles/*.md`. Schema: `title`, `date`,
  optional `author`/`description`/`heroImage`/`featured`, `tags[]`.
- **`glossary`** — `src/content/glossary/*.md`. Schema pairs a `traditional`
  term with the LIT rendering (`greek`, `lit`, `litMenu`, `srOnly`, optional
  `note`/`menuTraditional`). Files are named `<traditional>-<lit>.md`
  (e.g. `hell-hades.md`).

Book intros in `src/data/intros/` are plain Markdown (not a content
collection); they're read directly by the intro pages and the API manifest.

## Key Conventions

- **Book keys**: lowercase, no spaces, no hyphens — `john`, `1corinthians`,
  `revelation`. Source of truth is `src/data/books.js` (`BOOKS`, `BOOK_ORDER`).
- **Chapter file naming**: `{bookKey}-{chapter}.json` (e.g. `1corinthians-1.json`).
- **Generated files are git-ignored** and regenerated at build time:
  `public/api/`, `public/search/topics.json`, `public/topics-index.json`,
  `dist/`, `.astro/`. Don't hand-edit them.
- **No client JS framework**, but `src/scripts/` *does* hold vanilla JS for
  progressive enhancement (verse highlighting/menus, footnote popovers, reading
  mode, search). Everything must degrade gracefully without JS.
- **Search is split into three client modules** in `src/scripts/`:
  `search-core.js` holds all logic that must agree between the SearchBar tray
  and the full `/search` page (book aliases, reference parsing, Pagefind query
  building, result-location math, topics-index loading); `searchbar.js` is the
  tray UI (loaded by `SearchBar.astro`); `search.js` is the `/search` page UI.
  Never duplicate parsing/bucketing logic into the UI modules — add it to
  `search-core.js` so both surfaces stay in sync.
- **Mobile apps are first-class consumers** of `public/api/` output — changing
  chapter/intro/manifest shape can break them. Treat the API as a contract.
- **Release notes are automated**: pushing changes to chapters, intros, glossary,
  or articles on `main` triggers `.github/workflows/release-notes.yml`, which
  runs `draft-release-notes.mjs` and commits to `release-notes.json`.
- **Agent/AI discovery surface** lives in static files, all served as-is from
  `public/`. They only take effect on a deployed Cloudflare Pages site — `dev`
  and `astro preview` do **not** apply `_headers`:
  - `public/.well-known/api-catalog` — RFC 9727/9264 `linkset+json` pointing at
    the public API (`/api/content.json`, `/api/manifest.json`) with `service-doc`
    (→ `llms-full.txt`) and `status` (→ `/api/version.json`) relations. It's
    extensionless, so `_headers` sets its `Content-Type: application/linkset+json`.
  - `public/_headers` adds `Link:` headers (RFC 8288) on `/*` advertising the
    catalog (`rel="api-catalog"`) and docs (`rel="service-doc"`).
  - `public/robots.txt` carries a `Content-Signal` line. Keep it consistent with
    the CC BY-NC-ND license and `llms.txt`: `ai-train=no` (no broad LLM training),
    `search=yes`, `ai-input=yes` (RAG/inference welcome). The site has no auth,
    MCP server, or write API, so OAuth/MCP/WebMCP discovery files are intentionally
    absent — don't add them without a real backing service.
