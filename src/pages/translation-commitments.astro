        <h2 id="tc-how">How these commitments work together</h2>

        <p>
          These commitments aren’t separate from each other but inform each
          other. They are also not weighted equally. They set the boundaries for
          each other and guide the choices that happen as I translate within
          those boundaries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Translation is not the same thing as decoding one-to-one meanings.
          Even what we were taught to do in early Greek classes isn’t the same
          as mature translation because translation isn’t just about looking
          things up in the dictionary and filling in the blank. True translation
          requires understanding the culture and mindset of the original writers
          and audience, looking at how and when words are used and what
          understanding is being communicated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes the first (or second or third) definition listed in the
          dictionary doesn’t communicate what the writer intended. Looking at
          the context around the word, around the whole Bible, in other
          literature of the time, the historical context and cultural contexts
          (yes, there were multiple cultures influencing the writers at the same
          time) all must be seriously considered. It’s about making thousands of
          tiny judgments about tone, imagery, ambiguity, and what a sentence is
          trying to communicate for the reader while staying anchored to what
          the Greek can honestly bear.
        </p>

        <p>
          I set out to translate with meaning-first clarity and source-text
          accountability. Following Nida’s focus on communicating the text’s
          function in the target language, I aim for English that lands with the
          kind of effect the Greek likely produced, rather than preserving
          churchy phrasing for its own sake. I want English-speaking readers to
          have, as close as possible, the same experience the original
          Greek-speaking audiences would likely have had. And following Pym’s
          emphasis on translation as a series of choices with real consequences,
          I make my decisions transparent, manage risk through careful wording
          and footnotes, and resist “default” English options that import
          theology or stigma not required by the text.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Faithfulness to the text</strong> sets the boundaries for all the
          other commitments. Every translation decision is intended to stay inside
          the semantic range (the realm of possible meaning) of the Greek. It does
          that by paying attention to lexical definitions, patterns of word usage
          both inside and outside the Bible, and careful attention to how it fits
          into the grammar and syntax of the whole passage, as well as literary purpose,
          metaphor, and voice.
        </p>

        <p>
          But faithfulness isn’t the same thing as repeating inherited
          church-language. So <strong
            >avoiding religious technical language</strong
          > pushes against the automatic use of jargon, not because tradition is worthless,
          but because tradition always carries baggage with it. For instance, the
          word “flesh” is not an incorrect translation of <em>sarx</em>, but
          because the tradition has turned it into jargon, it’s not neutral. It
          carries doctrinal meaning that may or may not have been part of the
          original intention. Using fresh language allows readers to be curious
          about the meaning in new ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          The rest of the commitments address the ethics of translation. Most
          translators pretend to be neutral or not to see the ethical impact of
          their decisions. They pretend that in attempting to be faithful to the
          text, they can’t possibly go wrong in other ways. They are wrong
          because there are many ways to stay faithful to the original language
          that are all technically valid but that lead to very different
          meanings in English and impacts on readers, churches, and theology.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Bible is a library produced by communities under empire, and it
          consistently critiques domination. So
          <strong>reading with the oppressed</strong> means the “default reader” is
          not the powerful, the secure, or the socially protected. It means asking,
          in every passage: who is vulnerable here, what is being normalized, and
          what kind of world does this wording quietly build? The renderings always
          still fall within the options of what the Greek can mean despite choosing
          options that may be quite different from what other translators who are
          more comfortable with authoritarianism might choose.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Trauma-informed translation</strong> adds another layer of honesty:
          some passages have a long history of being weaponized. When the Greek allows
          more than one responsible rendering, the LIT will prefer options that reduce
          shame and harm without altering meaning. And where the text itself is hard
          to swallow, the LIT aims to be transparent by using footnotes to explain
          interpretive choices rather than disguising them. It is not about softening
          language. It’s about refusing to select wording that instills shame when
          a non-shaming option exists. In fact, it can explicitly be about refusing
          to soften the reality of harm that is captured in the text, such as translating
          <em>doulos</em> as “enslaved person” instead of as “servant.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, <strong>God always looks like Jesus</strong> and
          <strong>belovedness and belonging</strong> are about refusing to allow the
          act of translating and the LIT itself to drift into a cold, academic translation
          that accidentally reinforces the very exclusion the Gospel confronts. When
          the Greek forces hard questions about God, power, wrath, judgment, or worthiness,
          the LIT treats Jesus as the clearest lens for what God is like and treats
          human dignity as non-negotiable. After all, Christ is “the image of God,
          who is unseen.” In practice, this means the translation chooses the options
          from among the many possible ones that point the meaning toward the character
          and values that are clearly taught and modeled by Jesus and the themes of
          love and belonging for all that served as the core of that message.
