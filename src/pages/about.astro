      <h2 id="about-translator">About the translator</h2>

      <p>
        For a long time, I thought I was going to be a pastor and a theology
        professor, and I went to school for those things. I learned a lot that
        was genuinely helpful. I also learned a lot that made me scratch my
        head. In the end, I only served in one temporary pastor position, and by
        the time I was graduating with my Master of Divinity, I knew I wasn’t
        going to be a pastor or a professor anymore.
      </p>

      <h3>Where I came from</h3>

      <p>
        By the time I joined a church at age 11, faith had already left scars in
        my family. Both of my parents grew up Seventh-day Adventist, my mother
        in a Puerto Rican Adventist church, and my dad’s father was even a
        pastor for a few years. Both of my parents were hurt by that world and
        left Christianity entirely when I was a baby.
      </p>

      <p>
        At eleven, my mom brought me to an Easter sunrise service. When the
        pastor invited people to accept Jesus, I stood up. My mom had promised
        that if I ever wanted to pursue faith, she would support me, and she
        did. We started attending church together, and she returned to faith not
        long after.
      </p>

      <p>
        That first church was imperfect, but it gave me something that stuck.
        They called themselves “inter-denominational,” and they emphasized
        belonging across differences. That instinct shaped the path that
        followed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I moved through a wide range of Christian spaces:
        Evangelical, Pentecostal, Catholic monastic, Conservative Baptist,
        Presbyterian, and the Emerging Church movement. Later, my wife and I
        were drawn into New Monasticism and intentional community, where justice
        stopped being an idea and became a daily practice. Eventually, we found
        our way into an Anabaptist-rooted house church and intentional community
        called The Springwater Community, and over a decade later, that’s still
        our home.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve learned from all of it, some things I carry forward, and some I’m
        determined not to repeat.
      </p>

      <h3>How I got here</h3>

      <p>
        It took me a few years to figure out what to be when I grew up, and I
        ended up becoming a counselor instead. It turned out to be a much better
        fit. Counseling held onto all the parts of pastoral work that had drawn
        me in in the first place: supporting people, helping them learn and
        grow, being present when they needed not to be alone, and helping people
        see themselves more clearly.
      </p>

      <p>
        But that shift left me with a bunch of unused knowledge and skills. And,
        if I’m honest, the Bible is one of my neurodivergent special interests.
        I couldn’t just ignore it, so I kept learning on my own.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, with an otherwise unused bachelor’s degree where I double majored in
        Biblical Studies and Biblical Languages and minored in Spanish, a
        master’s degree in Divinity where I focused on biblical languages and
        biblical hermeneutics, and another decade of study on my own and in
        conversation with other Bible nerds about both the Bible and other
        languages like German, Japanese, and more Spanish, there’s a lot
        rattling around in my brain.
      </p>

      <h3>Why a new translation</h3>

      <p>
        As my family grew, I found myself wanting to share this special interest
        with my children. That’s when I ran into a problem. I can’t read the
        Bible without qualifying things, stopping every few sentences, sometimes
        every few words, to explain context, nuance, or what I think is actually
        going on in the text.
      </p>

      <p>That’s no way to read the Bible.</p>

      <p>
        For years, I dreamed about creating a version that would be accessible
        to my children without dumbing the text down, and that would also help
        them see the values I believe the Bible consistently points toward. When
        the shutdowns happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, I suddenly found
        myself with the time and energy to finally put toward that idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I started sharing my translation work, friends responded with
        curiosity, encouragement, and thoughtful questions. Ultimately, they
        encouraged me to keep going.
      </p>

      <h3>Why this work exists</h3>

      <p>
        The deeper I dug into exploring the original languages, seeing patterns
        emerge, and questioning assumptions that weren’t part of the language
        itself, the more I began to notice significant differences between the
        original text and English translations. I discovered new clarity in
        themes, connections within the text, and a whole range of possibilities
        I would never have known were there. It gave me new eyes to read
        familiar texts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing this work bring meaning to my friends and acquaintances has given
        me a growing sense of excitement—about joining the work of the Spirit,
        standing alongside many others who have wrestled honestly with
        Scripture, and exploring what it might mean to share this translation
        with a wider community.

      <h2 id="about-lit">About the Liberation and Inclusion Translation</h2>

      <p>
        This project didn’t begin as a public translation. It grew out of years
        of study, pastoral formation, living in Christian community, counseling
        work, and the realization that how we translate Scripture shapes how
        people experience God, themselves, and one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I kept returning to the Greek text, I noticed something that had
        bothered me for a long time: much of what makes the good news good—the
        liberating movements, restorative teachings, radical inclusion, healing,
        empowerment, embodiment, and insistence on loving justice in the New
        Testament—wasn’t coming through clearly enough in English. Sometimes
        that was because of theological tradition. Sometimes it was because of
        habit. Often it was because familiar religious language had trained us
        to be numb to what the text was actually doing.
      </p>

      <h3>“Word-by-word” doesn’t mean neutral</h3>

      <p>
        The LIT is translated word-by-word directly from the Greek texts,
        working closely with grammar, syntax, and historical context. In that
        sense, it is word-based. But Greek is not a code with fixed English
        equivalents, and translation is never a mechanical process.
      </p>

      <p>A single Greek word often carries a range of meanings:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Charis</em> can mean grace, favor, generosity, gift, or gratitude.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Sarx</em> can mean flesh, body, family, embodied humanity, or self-preservation
          instincts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Pistis</em> can mean faith, faithfulness, commitment, trust, allegiance,
          or confidence.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Every translation has to decide which sense is doing the work in a given
        passage, whether to preserve ambiguity or clarify it, and whether to
        echo inherited theological language or let the context speak more
        directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The LIT doesn’t pretend to avoid those decisions. Instead, it makes them
        deliberately, choosing English that reflects what the Greek is actually
        communicating in context, often letting go of familiar phrasing to do
        that more clearly.
      </p>

      <h3>Why the language often sounds unfamiliar</h3>

      <p>
        Many English translations rely on traditional church vocabulary that has
        accumulated centuries of doctrinal meaning. Sometimes that language is
        helpful. More often, it narrows, distorts, or mutes what the text
        originally conveyed.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the LIT, you’ll see terms rendered in ways that may feel unfamiliar
        at first:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>ekklesia</em> as <strong>“called community”</strong> (traditionally,
          “church”)
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>pneuma</em> as <strong>“life-breath”</strong> (traditionally, “spirit”)
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>euangelion</em> as <strong>“triumphant message”</strong>
          (traditionally, “gospel”)
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>sōtērion</em> as <strong>“liberation”</strong> (traditionally, “salvation”)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These choices aren’t meant to be provocative. They are attempts to
        surface the social, relational, and political dimensions of the text
        that can disappear behind religious shorthand. Where a choice might
        raise questions, the translation is annotated with footnotes so readers
        can see the Greek term, its range of meanings, and the reasoning behind
        the rendering.
      </p>

      <h3>Not a paraphrase, not a frozen literalism</h3>

      <p>
        Although the LIT often reads fluidly and with unfamiliar phrasing, it is
        not a paraphrase. Every line is translated from the Greek, and every
        rendering stays within the recognized semantic range of the source
        language.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, it resists a kind of literalism that treats English
        words as interchangeable containers for Greek ones. The goal is not to
        reproduce Greek grammar in English, but to communicate meaning
        faithfully and responsibly to modern readers who don’t live in the world
        of the first century. ested.
      </p>

      <p>
        You could think of the LIT as an annotated translation where
        interpretive work is made visible rather than hidden behind the
        appearance of neutrality.
      </p>

      <h3>In dialogue with the text, not with tradition</h3>

      <p>
        Many translations are shaped primarily by doctrinal clarity, liturgical
        use, or reverence as defined by later theological frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>This translation takes a different starting point. It prioritizes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>historical and linguistic integrity,</li>
        <li>attention to power, community, and marginalization in the text,</li>
        <li>and reader comprehension over inherited piety.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That means it does not claim neutrality. Translation is always
        interpretation, and interpretation always reflects values. Rather than
        disguising those values, the LIT names them so readers can engage the
        text with awareness.
      </p>

      <h3>Core commitments</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Faithfulness to the text</strong><br />
          Translation choices are grounded in grammar, syntax, and historical context,
          not doctrinal shortcuts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clarity over religious technical language</strong><br />
          Traditional theological terms are reconsidered when they obscure meaning,
          import later doctrine, or soften the text’s original force.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attention to harm and trauma</strong><br />
          Where Scripture has been used to shame, exclude, or justify harm, the translation
          asks whether that harm arises from the text itself or from how it has been
          rendered and taught.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>God looks like Jesus</strong><br />
          The character of God is interpreted consistently with Jesus’ life, teaching,
          and self-giving love, rather than through abstract or punitive frameworks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Belonging and restoration</strong><br />
          The translation highlights the Bible’s recurring concern with communal repair,
          shared dignity, and life together rather than fear-based exclusion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What this translation is—and isn’t</h3>

      <p>
        The LIT is a theological, interpretive translation rooted in
        historical-critical scholarship and shaped by concern for lived
        experience. It is offered as one faithful contribution among many.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not a claim to be the most literal or most neutral Bible, not a
        replacement for other translations, and not a final word on the meaning
        of Scripture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Readers are encouraged to read it alongside other translations,
        commentaries, and voices, engaging it as part of an ongoing communal
        conversation.
      </p>

      <h3>An invitation</h3>

      <p>
        This project exists because translation shapes theology, and theology
        shapes lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        For many people—especially those who have been harmed or excluded by how
        Scripture has been translated and taught—those choices have mattered
        deeply.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Liberation and Inclusion Translation invites readers to slow down,
        notice where translation choices matter, question inherited language,
        and encounter the text as a living witness to justice, healing, and
        shared belonging.

      <h2 id="about-site">About this site</h2>

      <p>
        This website is intentionally simple, transparent, and accessible. It is
        built as a static site, meaning there are no ads, no tracking scripts,
        no paywalls, and no algorithms shaping what you see.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Liberation and Inclusion Translation is offered freely online
        because access to sacred texts and interpretive work should not be
        restricted by income, institutional affiliation, or geography.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is a work in progress. Text, notes, and structure may evolve
        as the translation continues and feedback is incorporated. Revisions are
        made carefully and publicly, with the aim of improved clarity, accuracy,
        and readability.
      </p>

      <h3>How to use this site</h3>

      <p>
        If you want to read from beginning to end, you can. If you prefer to
        move between passages, books, and themes, that works too. You do not
        need to follow a fixed order or agree with every translation choice to
        engage meaningfully with the text.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use the <a href="/read">Read Now</a> page to choose a book and chapter directly.
        It also shows which books are available now and which are still coming later.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can read individual passages on their own, move between books, or
        compare the translation here with other versions you already know. The
        navigation and structure are meant to support curiosity rather than
        enforce a particular path.
      </p>

      <p>
        Footnotes are an important part of the translation, but they are
        optional. Some readers will want to read straight through and return to
        the notes later; others will move back and forth frequently. Both
        approaches are valid.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site can be used for study, reflection, group discussion, teaching,
        or quiet reading. It is not designed for speed or volume, but for
        attentiveness. Taking your time here is part of how the translation is
        meant to be read.

            <p>Short answer: it isn’t.</p>
            <p>
              Longer answer: there is no such thing as the “best” translation.
              Every translation has a particular focus, set of priorities, and
              set of biases. Most widely used English translations emerge from
              conservative Evangelical traditions. This one does not.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Liberation and Inclusion Translation seeks to highlight themes
              and valid translation options that emerge from my own formation,
              commitments, and questions as a translator. Rather than pretending
              neutrality, I try to be as aware of my biases as possible and
              transparent about them, so readers can make informed decisions
              about how they engage the text for themselves.

              I encourage readers to continue engaging other translations,
              commentaries, and writers who bring different insights and
              perspectives. No single translation, whether produced by one
              person or a large committee, should dominate anyone’s
              understanding of Scripture or spiritual truth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Interpretation happens in community, through conversation,
              comparison, and listening to many voices over time.

              The LIT is written for readers who want to engage Scripture
              thoughtfully, including pastors, students, counselors, teachers,
              skeptics, and people who have been harmed or excluded by how the
              Bible has been translated and taught.
            </p>
            <p>
              It assumes curiosity rather than agreement, and engagement rather
              than certainty.

        <details class="faq-item">

          <div class="faq-a">
            <p>
              No. The LIT is a translation made directly from the original
              languages, working closely with grammar, syntax, and historical
              context. Every rendering stays within the recognized semantic
              range of the source text.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, translation always involves interpretation.
              Where choices are difficult or contested, that interpretive work
              is made visible through footnotes rather than hidden behind
              familiar phrasing.

            Why does the language sometimes sound unfamiliar or unsettling?
          </summary>
          <div class="faq-a">
            <p>
              Much traditional Bible language has accumulated centuries of
              theological and cultural meaning. Familiar words can feel safe
              even when they no longer communicate what the original text was
              doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The LIT sometimes uses unfamiliar phrasing to help readers notice
              details, stay curious, and pay closer attention to passages that
              have become rote or glossed over through familiarity and inherited
              tradition. The goal is not to be provocative, but to promote
              clarity and attentiveness.

          <div class="faq-a">
            <p>
              Every translation reflects values. Decisions about wording,
              emphasis, and clarity always shape how a text is heard.
            </p>
            <p>
              The LIT is biased in the same way all translations are biased. It
              is not, however, attempting to make the text say something it does
              not already say. From within the range of possible meanings,
              particular choices are made through the lens of the commitments
              guiding this work, commitments that may differ from those shaping
              other translations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than claiming neutrality, the LIT names its commitments
              openly, including faithfulness to the text, attentiveness to harm
              and exclusion, and interpretation of God’s character through the
              life and teaching of Jesus. Readers are invited to engage those
              commitments critically and thoughtfully.

              I have worked diligently, building on formal academic training
              with ongoing self-study and years of engagement with the biblical
              languages. I consult reference materials regularly and aim to make
              careful, responsible translation decisions.

              That said, this is a semi-scholarly work that is still in
              progress. Most translation choices have not been subjected to
              exhaustive textual criticism, journal-level research, or peer
              review. Readers are encouraged to pursue their own supplemental
              study and come to their own conclusions about difficult or
              disputed passages.

              The New Testament is being translated and published progressively.
              All books are currently drafts that will be reviewed and updated
              in the future. Most books are complete, but some are not yet
              available. A list of currently available books can be found on the <a

            <p>That is difficult to answer.</p>
            <p>
              More than half of the New Testament has been translated so far. My
              hope is to complete a first full draft sometime in 2026. As my
              understanding has deepened through this project, I have also
              become aware of ways earlier books can be improved.
            </p>
            <p>
              I plan to revise all books at least once after completing their
              initial drafts, a process that will likely take several additional
              years. After that, work on the Hebrew Bible will begin. This is a
              long-term project.

              That response is welcome. Disagreement often means the text is

              Readers are encouraged to compare the LIT with other translations,
              consult the footnotes, and engage the reasoning behind a choice
              rather than assuming carelessness or bad faith. If you believe the
              original language is communicating something that is not reflected
              here, feedback is welcome so the translation can continue to
              improve.
