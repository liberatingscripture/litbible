  "<p id=\"luke-4-p8\"><sup id=\"v13\" class=\"vn\">13</sup>&nbsp;After bringing all the testing to an end, the False Accuser left him until another opportunity.</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p9\"><sup id=\"v14\" class=\"vn\">14</sup>&nbsp;Jesus returned to Galilee with the power of the Life-breath, and news about him went out to the whole surrounding area. <sup id=\"v15\" class=\"vn\">15</sup>&nbsp;He began teaching in their synagogues, being praised by all.</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p10\"><sup id=\"v16\" class=\"vn\">16</sup>&nbsp;He went to Nazareth, where he was brought up, and entered the synagogue on <i>Shabbat</i>, according to custom. He stood up to read, <sup id=\"v17\" class=\"vn\">17</sup>&nbsp;and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. After opening the scroll, he found the place where it was written,</p>",
  "<blockquote id=\"luke-4-p11\" class=\"hbq\"><p class=\"hbq-line\"><sup id=\"v18\" class=\"vn\">18</sup>&nbsp;“The Life-breath of The-One-Who-Is Sovereign<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-r\" href=\"#fn-r\" role=\"doc-noteref\">r</a></sup> is upon me</p><p class=\"hbq-line\">For the sake of whom she<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-s\" href=\"#fn-s\" role=\"doc-noteref\">s</a></sup> anointed me</p><p class=\"hbq-line\">To bring news of triumph<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-t\" href=\"#fn-t\" role=\"doc-noteref\">t</a></sup> for people in poverty,</p><p class=\"hbq-line\">And she sent me to announce release for people who are imprisoned,</p><p class=\"hbq-line\">And recover sight for those who cannot see,</p><p class=\"hbq-line\">To send out in freedom those who have been crushed,</p><p class=\"hbq-line\"><sup id=\"v19\" class=\"vn\">19</sup>&nbsp;To announce the coming arrival of the year filled with what is acceptable to the Sovereign One.”<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-u\" href=\"#fn-u\" role=\"doc-noteref\">u</a></sup></p></blockquote>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p12\"><sup id=\"v20\" class=\"vn\">20</sup>&nbsp;After closing the scroll, he gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were focused on him.</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p13\"><sup id=\"v21\" class=\"vn\">21</sup>&nbsp;“Today, this scripture has been lived out<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-v\" href=\"#fn-v\" role=\"doc-noteref\">v</a></sup> as you heard it,” he began telling them.</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p14\"><sup id=\"v22\" class=\"vn\">22</sup>&nbsp;They were all telling others about him and were shocked at the gracious words coming out of his mouth, and they said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p15\"><sup id=\"v23\" class=\"vn\">23</sup>&nbsp;“Without doubt, you will recite to me this cliché: ‘Heal yourself, Doctor!’” he told them. “And you’ll say, ‘Do all the things we heard were happening in Capernaum here in your hometown too.’”</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p16\"><sup id=\"v24\" class=\"vn\">24</sup>&nbsp;Then he said, “Truly, I’m telling you that no prophet is acceptable in their hometown. <sup id=\"v25\" class=\"vn\">25</sup>&nbsp;Speaking of truth, I tell you, there were many bereaved women<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-w\" href=\"#fn-w\" role=\"doc-noteref\">w</a></sup> in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut tight<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-x\" href=\"#fn-x\" role=\"doc-noteref\">x</a></sup> for three years and six months, as a severe famine happened throughout all the land.<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-y\" href=\"#fn-y\" role=\"doc-noteref\">y</a></sup> <sup id=\"v26\" class=\"vn\">26</sup>&nbsp;Elijah was sent to none of them but only to a woman who was bereaved in Zarephath of Sidon.<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-z\" href=\"#fn-z\" role=\"doc-noteref\">z</a></sup> <sup id=\"v27\" class=\"vn\">27</sup>&nbsp;There were also many people with skin diseases in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.”</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p17\"><sup id=\"v28\" class=\"vn\">28</sup>&nbsp;Everyone in the synagogue was filled with rage when they heard these things. <sup id=\"v29\" class=\"vn\">29</sup>&nbsp;They stood up, drove him out of the town, and brought him to the ridge of the hill on which their town was built so that they could throw him down. <sup id=\"v30\" class=\"vn\">30</sup>&nbsp;However, after slipping through the middle of the crowd, he continued his travels.</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p18\"><sup id=\"v31\" class=\"vn\">31</sup>&nbsp;He went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. He began teaching the people there each <i>Shabbat</i>,<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-aa\" href=\"#fn-aa\" role=\"doc-noteref\">aa</a></sup> <sup id=\"v32\" class=\"vn\">32</sup>&nbsp;and they were amazed at his teaching because his message was spoken with complete autonomy.<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-bb\" href=\"#fn-bb\" role=\"doc-noteref\">bb</a></sup></p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p19\"><sup id=\"v33\" class=\"vn\">33</sup>&nbsp;There was a person in the synagogue who had a spirit,<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-cc\" href=\"#fn-cc\" role=\"doc-noteref\">cc</a></sup> an unclean demon, and he called out with a loud voice, <sup id=\"v34\" class=\"vn\">34</sup>&nbsp;“Ah! What is there between you and us, Jesus the Nazarene! Did you come to destroy us? I’ve understood who you are: The one designated for sacred purposes by God!”<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-dd\" href=\"#fn-dd\" role=\"doc-noteref\">dd</a></sup></p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p20\"><sup id=\"v35\" class=\"vn\">35</sup>&nbsp;“Silence!” Jesus commanded it sharply, “Get out of him!” After the demon threw him to the ground in the middle of the crowd, it left him without injuring him.</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p21\"><sup id=\"v36\" class=\"vn\">36</sup>&nbsp;Everyone was stunned, and they began to say to each other, “What does this mean? Because he gives orders to unclean spirits with authority<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-ee\" href=\"#fn-ee\" role=\"doc-noteref\">ee</a></sup> and power, and they come out!” <sup id=\"v37\" class=\"vn\">37</sup>&nbsp;News about him traveled everywhere throughout the region.</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p22\"><sup id=\"v38\" class=\"vn\">38</sup>&nbsp;After standing up and leaving the synagogue, Jesus<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-ff\" href=\"#fn-ff\" role=\"doc-noteref\">ff</a></sup> went into Simeon’s<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-gg\" href=\"#fn-gg\" role=\"doc-noteref\">gg</a></sup> house. Simeon’s mother-in-law was there suffering from a severe fever, and they made a request to Jesus<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-hh\" href=\"#fn-hh\" role=\"doc-noteref\">hh</a></sup> for her. <sup id=\"v39\" class=\"vn\">39</sup>&nbsp;So, standing over her, he sharply commanded the fever, and it left her. Standing up right away, she began to show them hospitality.<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-ii\" href=\"#fn-ii\" role=\"doc-noteref\">ii</a></sup></p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p23\"><sup id=\"v40\" class=\"vn\">40</sup>&nbsp;As the sun was setting, everyone with people who were sick with various diseases brought them to him. Placing his hands on each one of them, he healed them. <sup id=\"v41\" class=\"vn\">41</sup>&nbsp;Demons were coming out of many, calling out, “You are the Son of God!” He confronted them sharply and didn’t allow them to speak because they perceived him to be the Christ.<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-jj\" href=\"#fn-jj\" role=\"doc-noteref\">jj</a></sup></p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p24\"><sup id=\"v42\" class=\"vn\">42</sup>&nbsp;At daybreak, Jesus went out and traveled to a solitary place, but the crowds were searching for him. They reached him and kept preventing him from leaving them.</p>",
  "<p id=\"luke-4-p25\"><sup id=\"v43\" class=\"vn\">43</sup>&nbsp;“I have to bring the news of the triumph of God’s reign to other towns too,” he told them, “because that’s why I was sent.” <sup id=\"v44\" class=\"vn\">44</sup>&nbsp;And he continued announcing it in the synagogues of Galilee.<sup class=\"fn-ref\"><a id=\"fnref-kk\" href=\"#fn-kk\" role=\"doc-noteref\">kk</a></sup></p>"

Hebrew and Latin also use the same word for all these concepts. In scripture, it typically calls back the image to Genesis 1 and 2: “the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters” (Genesis 1:2 NASB) and “the Lord God formed the human from the topsoil of the fertile land and blew life’s breath into [its] nostrils. The human came to life.” (Genesis 2:7 CEB)." },

That region was the location of the Essene community of Qumran, where many speculate Johanan (John) resided. Additionally, the ‘wilderness’ in the Hebrew Bible is consistently used to represent chaos and scarcity, neglect of needs, sense of threat and hostility, and the place where those things originate, a return to the formlessness and emptiness preceding Creation." },
    { "id": "fn-d", "refId": "fnref-d", "label": "d", "html": "This is a more literal translation of the Greek <i>diabolon</i>. There’s a history of it being transliterated into other languages and eventually becoming traditionally ‘devil,’ but doing so obscures the meaning of what’s being communicated." },

    { "id": "fn-g", "refId": "fnref-g", "label": "g", "html": "The Greek word <i>basileia</i> can mean territories (“kingdoms”) or the governing systems that rule them. Rendering it ‘regimes’ here highlights that the test is whether Jesus will succumb to attempting to fulfill his calling through forced domination of the rulers, forcing them to fall under his rule. Essentially, The False Accuser is offering to make Jesus the new emperor in place of Caesar." },
    { "id": "fn-h", "refId": "fnref-h", "label": "h", "html": "The Greek term <i>oikoumene</i> is different than <i>kosmos</i> (“world”). It refers specifically to “the known world” or “developed area” as opposed to the places inhabited by “uncivilized” (unconquered) peoples or vast, uninhabited wilderness. Essentially, it referred to the area controlled by the Roman Empire." },
    { "id": "fn-i", "refId": "fnref-i", "label": "i", "html": "Sometimes this word is translated ‘worship.’ That could be a misleading word here, since it is not about praising the goodness of a divine figure but rather submitting to a ruling figure." },
    { "id": "fn-j", "refId": "fnref-j", "label": "j", "html": "“The-One-Who-Is” is used to translate the Greek <i>kurios</i> (traditionally, “Lord”) when it refers to God, especially in Hebrew Bible quotations. In the Septuagint, <i>kurios</i> regularly replaces the Divine Name (<i>YHWH</i>) following a Jewish oral tradition of saying <i>Adonai</i> aloud wherever the text read <i>YHWH</i>. Translating <i>kurios</i> as “The-One-Who-Is” recovers the Name’s resonance with the Hebrew root <i>haya</i> (“to be”), echoes Exodus 3:14 (<i>Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh</i>), and resists the patriarchal/hierarchical connotations of “Lord” in English, while recalling the liberating presence revealed at the burning bush." },
    { "id": "fn-k", "refId": "fnref-k", "label": "k", "html": "The word translated here as ‘serve as representative’ is the Greek word <i>latreuo</i>.

It carries a ritual quality and an implication of representing a deity or king in performing rituals." },

    { "id": "fn-s", "refId": "fnref-s", "label": "s", "html": "There is no explicit pronoun in the Greek here; the verb form marks the subject without gender. “Life-breath” is paired with feminine pronouns in English to reflect Hebrew linguistic heritage and theological tradition: in Hebrew, “Spirit” is grammatically feminine, and there is a rich tradition of imagining the Spirit/Life-breath as feminine." },
    { "id": "fn-t", "refId": "fnref-t", "label": "t", "html": "Traditionally, “bring this good news.” The verb <i>euangelizo</i> means to announce or carry the <i>euangelion</i> (often “gospel/good news”).
